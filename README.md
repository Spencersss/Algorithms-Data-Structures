# Algorithms & Data Structures

A simple repository containing a large set of algorithms and data structures written in a variety of languages.

Contributions are welcome and hopefully those who discover this repository find it useful!

## Repo Structure

The repository is divided into two directories being both `data-structures` and `algorithms` with each containing sub-directories that will follow the name of a provided data structure or algorithm. 

Contained within these sub-directories are the implementation(s) of the specified data structure or algorithm. Simple!

## Adding A New Algorithm Or Data Structure

1. Choose the directory `algorithms` or `data-structures` to place your new addition under.
2. Create a new sub-directory within the decided folder with the name of your newly added structure or algorithm
3. Add a single file containing atleast one functioning implementation of the structure or algorithm in your preferred language and any relevant tests that you feel are necessary.
4. Once finalized, ensure your changes are on their own branch and create a pull request to the repository and await review.
